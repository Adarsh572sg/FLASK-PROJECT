# Flask Project - Basic Calculator

This repository contains a simple web-based calculator implemented using HTML and Flask. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations by entering two numbers and specifying the operation to be performed.

## Features

- Input fields for two numbers.
- An input field for specifying the arithmetic operation (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- A "Calculate" button that performs the calculation and displays the result.
- Simple and clean user interface.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: For designing the calculator's user interface.
- Flask: To create a backend server (if applicable for this project).

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adarsh572sg/FLASK-PROJECT.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd FLASK-PROJECT
   ```
3. If a backend Flask server is implemented, ensure you have Python installed and set up the Flask environment.
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```
4. Run the Flask application (if applicable):
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. Open the `basic calculator.html` file in your web browser to use the calculator:
   ```bash
   open basic\ calculator.html
   ```

## How to Use

1. Enter the first number in the "First Number" field.
2. Enter the second number in the "Second Number" field.
3. Specify the operation in the "Enter the operation" field. Supported operations include:
   - `+` for addition
   - `-` for subtraction
   - `*` for multiplication
   - `/` for division
4. Click on the "Calculate" button to display the result.

## Example

1. Input `4` as the first number.
2. Input `2` as the second number.
3. Input `+` as the operator.
4. Click "Calculate" to get the result: `6`.
